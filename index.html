<p> Hello GitHubber, my name is Binn. Currently enrolled at the <a href= "http://www.wildcodeschool.com">Wild Code School</a>, I'm pursuing a new career in the world of data science. Below you will find some of my past and ongoing group projects. </p>
	<h2> Projects </h2>
		<h3> <a href= "https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chinnawat.wisetwongsa/viz/Projet1-ToysModelsbyTheDeepThinkersbackup/Projet1-ToysModels">Toys & Models</a> </h3>
		<p> Analysis of sales data from a fictive company using MySQL Workbench. The project involved creating SQL queries to respond to questions related to HR, logistics, finances and sales. The acquired information was then visually summarized in a dashboard using Tableau Desktop. </p>
		<h3> <a href= "https://binn1908-cinecode-streamlit-v17tyj.streamlit.app/">Cin√©Code</a> </h3>
		<p> Creation of a film recommendation tool using machine learning (Nearest Neighbor classifier). Based on the vast movie database of IMDb, the final tool provides movie suggestions while taking into account the user's favorite movie or selection of specific criteria (genre, actors, etc.). Hosted on the Streamlit platform. </p>
		<h3> <a href= "https://binn1908-wild-travelers-streamlit-mhe5fh.streamlit.app/">Wild Travelers</a> </h3>
		<p> NLP (Natural Language Processing) and geocoding. The final project analyzes the descriptions of establishments referenced in the ADN Tourisme database in order to classify them as hotels or restaurants. The establishments are then displayed on an interactive map using pydeck.  </p>
